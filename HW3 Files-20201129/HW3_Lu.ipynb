Tensor is optimized for matrix calculation and can be loaded to a GPU. Tensor is also implemented so that it's easy to calculate and pass back chains of gradients, which is extremely useful for backpropagation on neural network. Second, a nice inner mechanism called Autograd that nicely map variables involved a chain of calculations and efficiently calculate their gradients via the chain rule when needed.

        "Now we are going to use the `GridSearch` function from `fairlearn.reductions` to try to mitigate this statistical parity discrepancy. This is one of the many ways to achieve this. What this function does is it gives higher weights to certain datapoints (determined by the sensitive feature) in order to change what the model learns. It automatically uses grid search to determine which weight should be given to `SEX==1` datapoints vs `SEX==2` datapoints (if you're interested you can read the source code). While it is called grid search, the space it searches is 1-dimensional. For our purposes, `GridSearch` takes four arguments: \n",

        "3. (Keyword argument) `grid_limit`. This determines the boundaries of the grid search. Basically, the `GridSearch` function will search the interval \\[-`grid_limit`,`grid_limit`\\] to find the weights. Choose this to be 0.8.\n",

Training should be done in less than 5 minutes. In the end this wrapper will contain `grid_size` many models, each corresponding to a different weight for datapoints."
